Title: Latour's Little Helpers
Description: This package contains the little things that I've written to help me out in my daily work. Most are helpful for data cleaning; there are some color palettes; some templates; maybe some plots. Most of this grew from doing repeated tasks and realizing that it was time to make a function. Extend that and I've realized that it's time to make a package.
