I followed \href{https://spencerschien.info/post/r_for_nonprofits/quarto_template/}{this great post} to
translate R Markdownâ€™s templating within R packages to the Quarto protocol. I
wanted to be able to easily create the skeleton for my preferred quarto
settings without copying and pasting them from a file over and over again.
