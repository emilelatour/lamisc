\title{Replace repeated values with a replacement string}
\usage{
check_above(x, replacement = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector (typically character or factor) to check for repeated consecutive values.}

\item{replacement}{A value (default is \code{""}) to replace repeated values with.}
}
\value{
A character vector where values that are the same as the previous value are replaced with \code{replacement}.
The first element is always retained.
}
\description{
This function checks whether each element in a vector \code{x} is the same as the element directly above it
(i.e., the previous value in the vector). If so, it replaces that element with a specified replacement value.
}
\details{
This is often useful for visual display in tables, where repeated values in consecutive rows can be suppressed
for readability.
}
\examples{
check_above(c("A", "A", "B", "B", "B", "C"))
# Returns: "A" "" "B" "" "" "C"
