\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble.}

\item{var}{A (non-empty) numeric vector of data values.}

\item{by}{A factor (or character) with two levels giving the corresponding groups.}

\item{mu}{A number indicating the true value of the mean (or difference in
means if you are performing a two sample test).}

\item{paired}{A logical indicating whether you want a paired t-test.}

\item{var_equal}{logical variable indicating whether to treat the two
variances as being equal. If TRUE then the pooled variance is used to
estimate the variance otherwise if FALSE then unequal variance is assumed
and the Welch (or Satterthwaite) approximation to the degrees of freedom is
used.}

\item{df_form}{If unequal variances are assumed, then specify to use "Welch"
or "Satterthwaite" (default) approximation to the degrees of freedom. R
\code{t.test} documentation says it uses "Welch" but actually they use
"Satterthwaite". At least, "Welch" in R matches "Satterthwaite" in Stata.}

\item{conf_level}{Confidence level of the interval. Default level is 0.95.}

\item{check_variance}{A logical whether to return some tests of homogeneity
of variances. Bartlett's, Levene's, Fligner, and check of the ratio of the
standard deviations.}

\item{reverse_groups}{If TRUE, then uses \code{forcats::fct_rev()} to reverse the
order of the groups being compared. Default is FALSE.}

\item{show_cohens_d}{Logical whether to return the effect size, Cohen's d.
T-test conventional effect sizes, proposed by Cohen, are: 0.2 (small effect),
0.5 (moderate effect) and 0.8 (large effect) (Cohen 1998, Navarro (2015)).
This means that if two groups' means donâ€™t differ by 0.2 standard
deviations or more, the difference is trivial, even if it is statistically
significant.}

\item{show_alternative}{Logical whether to show alternative hypothesis
notation in the test results. Default is FALSE.}
