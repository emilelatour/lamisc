\title{Calculate Fleiss' kappa and Krippendorff's alpha}
\usage{
k_alpha(ratings_t, alpha_q = 0.05, nboot = 1000, scaling = "nominal")
}
\arguments{
\item{ratings_t}{A matrix or data frame or tibble of the ratings. Rows =
individuals; columns = raters. Missing values coded by \code{NA}.}

\item{alpha_q}{Numeric; two-sided type one error, default = 0.05}

\item{nboot}{Integer; number of Bootstrap samples, default = 1000}

\item{scaling}{String; measurement scale ("nominal", "ordinal", "interval",
"ratio"), default = "nominal"}
}
\value{
A tibble with the following columns
\item{measure}{Name of the measure}
\item{scale}{Measurement scale}
\item{N_subjects}{For kappa: number of subjects without missing values; For
alpha: number of subjects with two or more ratings.}
\item{n_raters}{Number of raters}
\item{k_categories}{Number of categories}
\item{obs_agr}{Observed agreement for the complete cases and for all cases
with at least two ratings}
\item{estimate}{Point estimates: Fleiss' kappa and Krippendorff's alpha}
\item{lower_asym_ci}{Lower asymptotic confidence interval}
\item{upper_asym_ci}{Upper asymptotic confidence interval}
\item{lower_boot_ci}{Lower bootstrap confidence interval}
\item{upper_boot_ci}{Upper bootstrap confidence interval}
}
\description{
This function was adapted from the paper \emph{Measuring inter-rater reliability
for nominal data – which coefficients and confidence intervals are
appropriate?} by Zapf et al. Their work compared the two reliability measures
and confidence intervals to see which provide the best statistical properties
for the assessment of inter-rater reliability in different situations. With
their paper they provided supplemental R code which was adapted to this
function. Most is kept intact, but I adjusted the output to return a \code{tibble}
instead of a list and text like they had done.

Their conclusions: Fleiss' K and Krippendorff's alpha with bootstrap
confidence intervals are equally suitable for the analysis of reliability of
complete nominal data. The asymptotic confidence interval for Fleiss' K
should not be used. In the case of missing data or data or higher than
nominal order, Krippendorff’s alpha is recommended.
